## Overview

**REALTIME-DATASTREAMING** provides a foundation for building real-time data pipelines and dashboards. It leverages modern JavaScript workflows, containerized services (via Docker Compose), and real-time messaging (Kafka) to enable end-to-end streaming and visualization of data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: Modular data ingestion, processing, and streaming.
- **Kafka Integration**: Use of Apache Kafka for high-throughput, scalable, and fault-tolerant messaging.
- **Realtime Dashboard**: Visualize and monitor data flows in real-time.
- **Containerized Services**: Simplified deployment and orchestration with Docker Compose.
- **Configurable & Extensible**: Easily adapt pipelines and dashboards for custom requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- (Optional) [Kafka CLI tools](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theotorku/REALTIME-DATASTREAMING.git
   cd REALTIME-DATASTREAMING
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Services (including Kafka):**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   - If a frontend dashboard is present:
     ```bash
     cd realtime-dashboard
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For backend pipeline:
     ```bash
     cd data-pipeline
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

- **Data Pipeline**: Processes and streams data to Kafka topics.
- **Kafka**: Acts as the message broker for real-time data.
- **Realtime Dashboard**: Connects to Kafka (directly or via backend) to visualize data.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your dashboard configuration).

## Configuration

- **Kafka**: Configure broker endpoints and topics in relevant files under `kafka/` and `data-pipeline/`.
- **Dashboard**: Update API endpoints or websocket URLs in `realtime-dashboard/` configuration files.
- **Environment Variables**: Use a `.env` file in root or relevant submodules for secrets and configuration (not included by default).

## Development

- **Vite** is used for rapid frontend development.
- **Hot Reloading**: Run `npm run dev` in `realtime-dashboard` for auto-reloading UI changes.
- **Linting & Formatting**: (If ESLint/Prettier configured) Use standard linting workflows.
